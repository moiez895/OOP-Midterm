The Booking class represents a booking made by a member, storing the member's name and the slot number.
The program includes a user interface with a menu that allows users to book a slot, cancel a booking, view bookings, and exit the program. It handles input validation and provides feedback to users after each action.
Overall, the program provides a simple and effective way for members to manage their bookings for fitness classes.
